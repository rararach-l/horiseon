#Description
This is a refactoring of the codebase for the webpage of a marketing agency called Horiseon, so that it follows accessibility standards and is optimised for search engines. It uses semantic HTML, and CSS selectors and properties are consolidated and organised. 

#Installation
There are no installation requirements for this website.

#Usage
The codebase HTML and CSS files are commented to provide more details on what was amended. Future edits have been made more feasible by rearranging and commenting on the structure of the CSS, to allow for easy identification of sections.

This screenshot demonstrates how the webpage should appear in your browser. It is not responsive and should be viewed on a desktop, at a resolution above 768px, 

#Credits
This starter code was refactored using starter code provided by the edX and Department for Education, Skills for Life Front End Development Bootcamp, delivered by Trilogy Education Services.
